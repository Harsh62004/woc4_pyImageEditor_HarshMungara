# woc4_pyImageEditor_HarshMungara
Winter of code @ DAIICT
I am going to create a basic image editor using python. This is my first ever projcet in Github!

A little about the project:-

  I am making a simple photo editor using python and pillow for image manipulation. I used tkinter to create a GUI in which I create a Canvas and then I upload the image on the canvas and manipulate it according to the need. We can perform several functions such as crop, rotate, flip, mirror, and reset.(and more to be added).


Problems I faced:-
  1. Creating a toolbar- On youtube there are not many videos on how to create a toolbar in tkinter window. Though i managed to learn how to use pyqt5 and make toolbar, I was unable to add canvas to the tkinter window with toolbar.
  2. Filters- I wanted to add filters that we have on our phone gallery editor or the filters we have on instagram, but i couldn't. There are many source codes on github and other websites which exteacts the pixels and then chnage their color but it was too difficult for me to understand those.
  3. Icons & bg imgs- Its very simple to add an icon/bg image to the tkinter window and buttons, i wrote the code correctly but I was unable to see the img on the window. I tried installing different images/icons and use them with different sizes but it did'nt work. 
  4. Dark mode- I tried to make a window with dark colours, the problem is that the menubar is having default system colour which we cant change. So, everything on the window is dark except the menubar.(there is a file named "dark.py" in this repo which has dark theme),
