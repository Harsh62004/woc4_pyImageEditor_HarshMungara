# woc4_pyImageEditor_HarshMungara
Winter of code @ DAIICT
I am going to create a basic image editor using python. This is my first ever projcet in Github!

A little about the project:-

  I am making a simple photo editor using python and pillow for image manipulation. I used tkinter to create a GUI in which I create a Canvas and then I upload the image on the canvas and manipulate it according to the need. We can perform several functions such as crop, rotate, flip, mirror, and reset.(and many more to be added).
